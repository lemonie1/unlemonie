    <p> hey this is the <span style="color: rgb(134, 221, 255);"> ABOUT</span> page of my website :D. i'm writing this on feb 20th, and i just <br> made 
    this website! i think it's pretty cool, but i did take a lot of inspiration from dimden.dev <br> 
    and all the other little neocities websites. i made this cuz i was bored and i had <br> <span style="color: red;"> ANNUAL EXAMS IN LESS THAN 2 WEEKS AND WAS LAZY TO STUDY</span> but anyway, that's about it!  </p>

    <p> P.S <br> if you're reading this, you're probably viewing it while it was still <span style="color: yellow;"> BETA,</span> meaning you won't be able to access it normally <br> (foreshadowing to a different way to access this..) </p>
